\chapter*{Introduction}

Whenever there's a conversation between someone old and someone young, it's always lecturing. That's the way things have been and perhaps will always be. On my part, I'll try to be brief. We'll be talking about the things I deem important, about how I perceive them, and the experience I acquired over the years behind.\par

For our conversations I've picked the form of letter correspondence. This form, of course, is quite arbitrary. I imagine my friends as the readers of thesse letters. That way I can write more plainly.\par

Why did I put the letters in this particular order? I start by writing about the purpose and the meaning of life. Then we talk about the beauty in one's behaviour, the beauty in the world around us, the beauty in the arts. The basic idea behind the order is this: to perceive beauty around you needs beauty inside. You need to have a beautiful and deep soul, have strong morale. You can't see anything through binoculars unless your hands are steady.
