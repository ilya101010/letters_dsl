\chapter*{Introduction}

Every conversation between an old man and a young one turns into lecturing. Things have been this way, and perhaps, they will not change. I will do my best to be short and tell only of the things most important to me, about how I perceive them, share my life experience.\par

For my conversations with the reader I have chosen the form of letter correspondence. This, of course, is a mere nominal form. As my readers I envision my friends. This allows me to write plainly.\par

What is the motivation behind the order of the letters? I start my letters talking about the purpose and meaning of life, about the beauty in one's demeanor. After that I turn to discusisng the beauty of the world around us and the beauty we discover in arts. I do this, because one has to have a beautiful soul, feel deep, and stand for the right cause to understand the beauty around. Try holding binoculars while your hands are shaking -- you'll see nothing.
