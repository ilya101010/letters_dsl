\chapter{On jealousy}

Are you jealous of a heavyweight setting a new world record? What about a gymnast? And what about a record holder on diving?

Try to think about everything you know and can be possibly jealous of: you'll notice that the closer a thing is to your job and specialisation, the greter jealousy it can make you feel. It's like in the game: cold, warm, warmer, hot, burnt!

And the last stage of the game is finding the object hidden by other players. It's the same thing for jealousy. The closer the achievement of others are to your speciality and interests, the more you get burnt by jealousy.

It's an awful feeling. Jealousy hurts first of all the one who is jealous.

And now you see how to be free from this extremely painful feeling of jealousy: develop your skils, nurture your individuality, be yourself, and you will never be jealous.

Jealous is the one who is alien to himself.

Jealous is the one who can not distinguish himself from the rest.

If you are jealous, you just have not found yourself.
