\chapter{Good and bad influences}

At some age everyone has this thing: external influences. These influences can be extremely strong during a boy's or a girl's transition into an adult life, at a crossroads. After that the strngth of this influences decreases. But teenagers should remember about them and their patology and normality.

Maybe there's no noticable patology: it's natural that a growing individual, boy or girl,  wants to be grown up and independent. But they see their independence primarily in being free from the influence of their relatives. When they see their family, they see their "childishness". Sometimes families itself are accountable for this: they might not notice that their off-spring has grown up or wants to do that. But the habit of listening to parents has not gone away, and so the individual "listens" to people who treat him as an adult but who themselves have not become adult and truly independent.

There are good and bad influences. Remember that. Be aware about the bad influence. People with free will are never subject to it. they choose their road themselves. Weak people don't. Be afraid of uncontrollable influences: especially when you still lack the ability to precisely differntiate the good from the bad, when you like being commended and praised no matter for what.
