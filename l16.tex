\chapter{On greed}

I am not satisfied with the dictionary definitions of the word "greed": "Desire to satisfy an excessive, voracious need of something" or "stinginess, cupidity" (this was taken from one the best Russian language dictionary of 4 volumes, the first one was published in 1957). The definition is correct in general, but it does not reflect that disgust that fills me when I see greed in people. Greed is forgetting your dignity, attempt to put your material interests before your own self, it's the spiritual lopsidedness, an awkward direction of a thought that limits your worldview, a withered mind, a jaundiced eyesight, spite to yourself and others, oblivion about comradeship. Greed is not funny, it's humiliating. It is hostile to yourself and people around you.

It's a whole different story with reasonable thrift; greed is its distortion, a disease. Thrift is governed by your mind, greed controls your mind.
